<h1><font color="blue"><i>History of The Atlanta Zoo</i></font></H1>
The Atlanta Zoo has been around for years. To be exact, the zoo has been around since 1889, making it 129 years old. This zoo is very unique
in many ways. The Atlanta Zoo is only one of four zoos to have the giant panda. It encompasses an area over 40 acres. The large
area lays host to around 1,500 animals, over 220 species. There are all different types of settings according to the species. The Atlanta Zoo
features and African Safari, Amazon setting, Midlands, and much more.
	Each year more than a million people come through the zoo. It also features over 300 employees including a few on night duty to ensure that the 
	animals are all alright. The zoo also rescues animals that are hurt and found, and nurses them back to health. If they are incapable of returing 
	to the wild then they are at a permanent home in the zoo. A lot of people associate the zoo with bad things but that is not the case here. All 
	animals are well taken care of and kept safe at all times! Not to mention happy!
